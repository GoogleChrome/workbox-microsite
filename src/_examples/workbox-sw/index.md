`workbox-sw` is a high-level wrapper that ties together the smaller modules into
a single, consistent interface. For most developers, `workbox-sw` will
be all your service worker needs to handle routing and caching.

`workbox-sw` handles both precaching (using a manifest generated by
`workbox-cli`, `workbox-webpack-plugin`, or `workbox-build`), and runtime
caching. The example service worker for this page precaches a single file, and
then sets up a number of runtime caching routes that will match requests made
against various [https://httpbin.org/](https://httpbin.org/) endpoints.

You can see the runtime caching strategies in action by making requests:

<button id="precached">Request precached.txt</button>
<button id="hello">Request hello.txt</button>
<button id="notmatched">Request not-matched.dat</button>
<button id="delay">Request a Delayed Response</button>
<button id="random">Request Random Bytes</button>
<button id="image">Request an Image</button>
