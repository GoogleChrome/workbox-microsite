`{{ page.module }}` is {{ page.description }}

For most developers, `workbox-sw` will
be all your service worker needs to handle routing and caching.

`workbox-sw` handles both precaching (using a manifest generated by
`workbox-cli`, `workbox-webpack-plugin`, or `workbox-build`), and runtime
caching.

The example service worker for this page precaches a single file, and
then sets up a number of runtime caching routes that will match requests made
against various [https://httpbin.org/](https://httpbin.org/) endpoints and for
local files.

You can see the effect of the service worker by trying out the following:

<p>
  <button id="precached">Request precached.txt</button> to see how precached
  assets are served.
</p>

<p>
  <button id="hello">Request hello.txt</button> to see a RegExp route in action.
</p>
   
<p>
  <button id="notmatched">Request not-matched.dat</button> to demonstrate that
  requests which aren't matched by a route default to going against the network.
</p>

<p>
  <button id="delay">Request a Delayed Response</button> to see how a
  network-first strategey can have a maximum timeout, after which a previously
  cached response is used.
</p>

<p>
  <button id="image">Request an Image</button> demonstrates cache expiration by
  fetching one of three sequential images, when the maximum cache size is two.
