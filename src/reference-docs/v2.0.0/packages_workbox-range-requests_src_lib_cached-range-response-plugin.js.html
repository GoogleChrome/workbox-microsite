# workbox-range-requests

A helper library that instructs a service worker respond to HTTP requests
that include a [Range:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)
header with a subset of a full response.

If you are not already using Workbox, this library can be used in a
standalone form via
{@link handleRangeRequest|workbox.rangeRequests.handleRangeRequest}.

If you are using Workbox for routing or request handling already, then
{@link CacheRangeResponsePlugin} will offer the easiest integration.

**If your cached resources are large, use caution when adding this library.
Some browsers need to read the entire resource into memory before it can be
modified to respond to the request.**

 *
 * This class is meant to be automatically invoked as a plugin to a
 * {@link module:workbox-runtime-caching.RequestWrapper|RequestWrapper}, which
 * is used by the `workbox-sw` and `workbox-runtime-caching` modules. If you
 * are not using `workbox-sw` or `workbox-runtime-caching`, then using the
 * {@link handleRangeRequest} function directly is recommended.
 *
 * Under the hood, this will call `handleRangeRequest()`, passing
 * in the appropriate request and response objects.
 *
 * @example
 * const workboxSW = new WorkboxSW();
 *
 * const cacheFirstRangeHandler = workboxSW.strategies.cacheFirst({
 *   cacheName: 'range-requests',
 *   // There's no need to instantiate the class; all methods are static.
 *   plugins: [workbox.rangedRequests.CachedRangeResponsePlugin]
 * });
 *
 * // Create a route which will match all requests that have a Range: header,
 * // and handle them using a cache-first strategy, taking the Range: header
 * // into account.
 * workboxSW.registerRoute(
 *   ({event}) => event.request.headers.has('range'),
 *   cacheFirstRangeHandler
 * );
