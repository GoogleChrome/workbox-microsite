The `workbox-routing` module makes it easy to handle network requests using the
response strategy of your choice.

In this sample, we set up two routes to respond to two types of requests that
our page might make.

<button data-url="https://httpbin.org/bytes/1">Make Cross-Origin Request</button>
<button data-url="/manifest.json">Make a Local Request</button>
