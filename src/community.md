# Community & Support

There are a few ways you can get involved with Workbox
and learn more about current and future plans for the
project as well as help the community or get support.

## Stackoverflow

Stackoverflow is a great place to asking and answering
questions on how to use Workbox.

If you do raise a question please you use the
[workbox](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=workbox)
tag, this will help the community easily find and
answer your questions.

## Slack

Once a week the Core Workbox team will be on slack
for an hour or so to discuss upcoming changes as well
as future plans. If you are interested in learning
more or contributing then please feel free to join
the '#workbox' room on the [ChromiumDev Slack Channel](https://chromiumdev.slack.com/).

Times of when we'll be meeting are on the calendar below.

## Team Calendar
